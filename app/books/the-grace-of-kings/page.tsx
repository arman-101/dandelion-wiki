        summary: "During a grand Imperial Procession outside the city of Zudi, two fourteen-year-old schoolboys, the wily Kuni Garu and his nervous friend Rin Coda, skip class to witness the spectacle of Emperor Mapidéré's power. The procession is a display of Xana's might, featuring airships, dancers, and a choir singing praises of the unified Seven States.\n\nThe parade is suddenly and violently interrupted by an assassin from Haan, who attacks from a sophisticated, man-lifting kite. He drops fire bombs on the Emperor's mobile Throne Pagoda, a massive bamboo-and-silk structure. The Emperor is saved by his loyal guard captain, but the attack exposes his vulnerability. Amid the chaos, Kuni sees the raw fear in the Emperor's eyes, a realization that shatters his perception of absolute, god-like power. The assassin escapes as Imperial airships give chase, and a furious Emperor Mapidéré orders his capture at any cost.",

        summary: "In the Tunoa Islands, another fourteen-year-old, the physically imposing Mata Zyndu, watches the same Imperial procession with his uncle, Phin Zyndu. For Mata, the last heir of a once-great noble clan, the spectacle is not a source of awe but of deep-seated hatred. He sees the emperor not as a mighty ruler, but as a gaunt and fearful man.\n\nThe chapter then delves into the tragic history of his family. His grandfather, Marshal Dazu Zyndu, was a brilliant Cocru general known as the 'Bearded Tortoise' for his unbeatable defensive tactics against the Xana invasion. However, he was betrayed by his own suspicious king, forced into an open battle, and captured. The Xana general Gotha Tonyeti reneged on his promise of safety and had Dazu's entire surrendered army buried alive. The Zyndu Clan was systematically exterminated, with only Mata's uncle Phin escaping with the infant Mata. Raised in exile with the singular purpose of vengeance, Mata's life has been shaped by his uncle's constant refrain: 'Do not forget.'",

        summary: "Seven years after the kite attack, a twenty-one-year-old Kuni Garu is a well-known charismatic rogue in Zudi, charming his way through life without a steady job. In Zudi's bustling marketplace, he witnesses a corrupt corvée administrator attempting to extort a poor old woman from Xana to prevent her only remaining son from being conscripted into forced labor. Intervening, Kuni cleverly impersonates a notoriously stingy merchant's spendthrift son, 'Fin Crukédori.' He writes a fraudulent promissory note to pay the 'Prosperity Tax,' tricking the administrator and saving the boy. This entire act of compassionate defiance is secretly witnessed from a palanquin by Jia Matiza, the daughter of a wealthy rancher, who is immediately intrigued by his character and cleverness.",

At a party hosted by the mayor for her father, she encounters Kuni Garu attempting to crash the event using the same 'Fin Crukédori' alias. Amused, she grants him entry as her guest.\n\nThey quickly form a deep connection, finding in each other an intellectual and philosophical equal. While walking in the countryside, Jia introduces Kuni to the symbolism of the dandelion, a plant she admires for its hardiness, versatility, and resourcefulness—qualities she sees in him. Inspired by her belief in him and his own desire for a more meaningful life, Kuni decides to abandon his roguish ways. He asks his friend Cogo Yelu to get him a steady job as a corvée guard, allowing him to formally and successfully ask for Jia's hand in marriage.",

        summary: "Two years later, an aging and terminally ill Emperor Mapidéré is on a tour of the islands. He has a powerful dream in which the gods of Dara—including Kiji, Tututika, Kana, Rapa, and Fithowéo—materialize as giant statues and argue over his legacy and the future of the empire, foreshadowing a new war.\n\nAs the Emperor lies dying, his lifelong friend and Chatelain, Goran Pira, conspires with the ambitious Prime Minister Lügo Crupo to stage a coup. They forge an Imperial decree using the Emperor's seal, naming the younger, more pliable Prince Loshi as the new heir. They send this false edict along with poison to the true heir, Crown Prince Pulo, who obediently commits suicide. Prince Loshi ascends the throne as Emperor Erishi. To solidify his power and root out any dissenters at court, Crupo famously brings a stag into the Grand Audience Hall, calls it a horse, and has all ministers who dare to disagree with him executed for treason.",

Two laborers from Cocru, the bald Huno Krima and the sturdy Zopa Shigin, are made captains of a corvée crew. Delayed by relentless storms, they face certain execution for being late to their assignment. In a desperate gamble born of hopelessness, they create a fake prophecy by hiding a silk scroll reading 'Huno Krima Will Be King' inside a fish they purchase at a market.\n\nThe 'miracle' galvanizes the other laborers, who see it as a divine sign. Led by Krima and Shigin, and with the first blood shed by the young brothers Dafiro and Ratho Miro who kill their guards, the corvée crew rises up. They seize the town of Napi, open the imperial granaries to the starving populace, and spark the first major rebellion against the Xana Empire.",

        summary: "In Farun, the local Xana commander, Datun Zatoma, hears of the rebellion and attempts to co-opt the now twenty-five-year-old Mata Zyndu, hoping to use his famous family name to bolster his own power. He summons Mata and Phin to their ancestral castle. Instead of cooperating, Mata assassinates the commander, reclaiming his home with his first kill.\n\nInside the castle, Mata recovers his grandfather's legendary weapons: the composite bronze-and-steel sword Na-aroénna ('The Ender of Doubts') and the fearsome toothed cudgel Goremaw. His godlike martial prowess is then unleashed as he and Phin single-handedly slaughter most of the two-hundred-man Xana garrison in a brutal, bloody battle through the castle's halls. Mata raises the red-and-black raven banner of Cocru over the castle, and news of his incredible victory spreads, inspiring hundreds of volunteers to join his cause.",

Choosing to become an outlaw rather than submit to an unjust law, Kuni leads his remaining followers and guards deep into the Er-Mé Mountains.\n\nHis leadership is quickly cemented by what his men perceive as divine signs: one soldier has a prophetic dream about a 'Red Emperor' killing a 'White Emperor,' and Kuni then coincidentally slays a giant white python that attacks one of his men. However, a subsequent disastrous raid on a well-guarded merchant caravan results in the death of several of his followers, including the loyal soldier who had the dream. Sobered by this harsh dose of reality, Kuni abandons his romantic notions of banditry and resolves to become a more cautious and responsible leader, with the ultimate goal of protecting his family by capturing the city of Zudi.",

        summary: "The young Emperor Erishi is portrayed as a foolish, sheltered, and decadent ruler, completely detached from the reality of his crumbling empire. He spends his days in the Imperial capital of Pan indulging in childish fantasies and lavish projects, such as redesigning the Grand Audience Hall into a giant, interactive map of Dara with wine-filled seas and planning an elaborate maze made entirely of meat. Oblivious to the reports of famine and rebellion, he delegates all matters of state to his regent, Lügo Crupo, and his friend, Goran Pira, interested only in his own amusement.",

        summary: "Regent Lügo Crupo, though now the most powerful man in the empire, finds the actual work of governing to be tedious and resents being bogged down by constant reports of the growing rebellion. The chapter explores his past as a brilliant but low-born scholar who lived in the shadow of his naturally gifted and more celebrated rival, Tan Féüji. Consumed by jealousy and a feeling of being perpetually second-best, Crupo defected to Xana and eventually poisoned Féüji to secure his own position as advisor to the emperor.\n\nNow, annoyed by the persistent rebellion, he dismissively appoints the chief tax collector, Kindo Marana, as commander-in-chief of the army. The choice is seemingly absurd, intended simply to rid himself of a bureaucrat who keeps bothering him with trivial financial matters, allowing Crupo to focus on his own scholarly pursuits.",

Years ago, Pira fell deeply in love with Lady Maing, a captive serving woman from Amu. However, Emperor Mapidéré noticed her beauty and claimed her for himself. Maing later secretly gave birth to Pira's son. When the child's true parentage was discovered, the ruthless emperor had both mother and child murdered in front of Pira. This immense cruelty transformed Pira's loyalty into an unquenchable thirst for vengeance.

He develops a pragmatic plan to turn the empire's liabilities, like the masses of conscripted laborers and prisoners, into assets by impressing them into the army under the command of loyal Xana veterans.

        summary: "Gin Mazoti puts her and Luan Zya's audacious plans into motion. Using a clever deception involving a fake shipyard to distract Kindo Marana's aerial surveillance over Dasu, her forces secretly repair and utilize a forgotten section of Emperor Mapidéré's abandoned undersea Grand Tunnels. They launch a surprise attack through the tunnels on the neighboring island of Rui, the heart of the old Xana homeland. The island's capital, Kriphi, falls quickly, and the Hegemon's commander, Kindo Marana, is killed by Dafiro Miro, who reveals himself to have been working as a double agent for Kuni all along. With one swift strike, Kuni's forces have captured the strategic and symbolic heart of their enemy.",

Once the emperor has been overthrown, however, they each find themselves the leader of separate factions—two sides with very different ideas about how the world should be run and the meaning of justice.</p>
