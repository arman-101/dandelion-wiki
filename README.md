### Content Guidelines

- Be faithful to the canon (book references welcome and encouraged).
- Keep tone neutral and encyclopedic.
- Prefer concise sections over long walls of text.
- Use internal links for cross-references where relevant (e.g., `/characters/jia-matiza`).
- Add citations using the existing reference structure when possible.

### How to Add or Update Pages

The site uses statically defined page data objects and master indexes for listing/search. Pages live under category folders, and summary cards come from `app/data/wiki-data.ts`.

General rules:
- Slugs are lowercase and hyphenated (e.g., `kuni-garu`).
- Images go in `public/<category>/<slug>.png` (PNG preferred).
- Register the page in the corresponding master list so it appears on index pages and search.

#### Characters
1. Create a new page file by copying an existing one (e.g., `app/characters/kuni-garu/page.tsx`).
   - Path: `app/characters/<slug>/page.tsx`
   - Export a `Character`-shaped `characterData` object and render it with `PageTemplate`.
2. Add/replace an image at `public/characters/<slug>.png`.
3. Register it in `app/data/wiki-data.ts` by adding an entry to `ALL_CHARACTERS_DATA`:
   - Include `name`, `description`, `image`, and `link` (e.g., `"/characters/<slug>"`).
   - The `ALL_CHARACTERS` export is generated from `ALL_CHARACTERS_DATA` automatically.

#### Places
1. Create a new page at `app/places/<slug>/page.tsx` (copy any place page as a template).
2. Add `public/places/<slug>.png`.
3. Register it by appending an item to `ALL_PLACES_DATA` in `app/data/wiki-data.ts`:
   - Provide `name`, `description`, `image`, `link`, and `category` (e.g., `"state" | "city" | "island" | "landmark" | "beyond" | "etc"`).
   - `ALL_PLACES` is generated from `ALL_PLACES_DATA`.

#### Gods
1. Create a new page at `app/gods/<slug>/page.tsx`.
2. Add `public/gods/<slug>.png`.
3. Register it by adding to `ALL_GODS` in `app/data/wiki-data.ts`:
   - `{ title: '<Name>', path: '/gods/<slug>', type: 'God' }`.

#### Concepts
1. Create a new page at `app/concepts/<slug>/page.tsx`.
2. Add `public/concepts/<slug>.png`.
3. Register it by adding to `ALL_CONCEPTS_DATA` in `app/data/wiki-data.ts`.
   - `ALL_CONCEPTS` is generated from `ALL_CONCEPTS_DATA`.

### Updating Existing Pages

- Edit the relevant `page.tsx` file under its category (e.g., `app/characters/<slug>/page.tsx`).
- If you change the image, update the file in `public/<category>/<slug>.png` and ensure the path matches.
- If you change a page name or slug, also update its entry in `app/data/wiki-data.ts` so listings/search stay correct.

### Local Validation Checklist

- `npm run dev` starts without errors.
- New page renders at the correct route (e.g., `/characters/<slug>`).
- Appears in the category index page and in global search.
- Links in the infobox and content blocks resolve correctly.
